Today I decided to change the location of my Repository for KODI Popcorn Time

### Why?

Because I already published the second KODI Popcorn Time release candidate I decided to clean up project folder on Github. So I moved Repository and all releases to new project. In addition to this I have some ideas to create some more addons for Kodi and it would be pointless to have a separate repository for them.

In current project I deleted source code of repository and old releases of KODI Popcorn Time. From now on you can find all releases of my addons in new [location](https://github.com/markop159/Markop159-repository). If you have checked Auto-update for repository, it should start updating itself, so you do not need to do anything. If you have it set to update manually I recommend to update it as soon as possible.

I will leave last 2 releases in old project for at least 1 month to ensure that all of you update to the last version of Repository before I delete it.
