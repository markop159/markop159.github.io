### Introduction

I am interested in lots of thing. All the technical and IT stuff. Currently I am employed as a System Engineer and am not a very good programmer, in fact I currently suck at programming. So why "developer" blog then, you ask? Because I always strive to learn new things. I finished school this year (got my diploma) so I graduated in Computer Science and Informational Technology. At school we learned a little bit about programming (JAVA, C, OCAML, PHP, HTML5, ...). About OCAML I still do not know how to use it. :)
